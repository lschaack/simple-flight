Build with (ignoring '>'):

	After crashing into the ground, the physics will stop updating, so press space a couple times to add some speed if the airplane gets close to the ground, or 'r' to restart if you crash.
	An easy way to look around is just to fly where you want to go and press 'q' a couple of times. This scales time so that five presses yields 1/32 speed, which is probably plenty. Another five presses is 1/1024 speed, so that's definitely enough.

##### Key bindings #####

Key bindings:
mouse      Look and fly around
arrows     Look and fly around, much slower than the mouse
r/R        Back to starting position

space      Give the airplane a "push," can be held down to act as a sort of
              throttle, but the paper airplane texture will glitch back and
              forth while it is held.

qe         Scale physics by orders of 2 (q divide, e multiply)

f/F        Toggle fog
s/S        Toggle between short (18s) and long (360s) day
'l'        Toggle lighting
'L'        Toggle smooth/flat lighting

1/2/3/0    Look at traffic light, grass w/shaders, apartment window, or plane respectively
